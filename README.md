# Manic Pixie Dream Girl Generator
## SO what is this exactly?

Straight from [wikipedia](), a Manic Pixie Dream Girl is:
>a stock character type in films. Film critic Nathan Rabin, who coined the term after observing Kirsten Dunst's character in Elizabethtown (2005), said that the MPDG "exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."[1] MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.

If you're wondering why, I conveniently decided to learn Elm shortly after rewatching Scott Pilgrim vs The World and was semi inspired by Ramona Flowers.

This application incorporates `elm\http`, `elm\random`, `elm\svg` and `elm-bootstrap` to create a random generator.

It was my first project in Elm, and I'm very very proud (even if the topic is retrospectively pretty lame)
