# Manic Pixie Dream Girl Generator
## So wtf is this...
Well according to Wikipedia, a Manic Pixie Dream Girl is defined as 
>stock character type in films. Film critic Nathan Rabin, who coined the term after observing Kirsten Dunst's character in Elizabethtown (2005), said that the MPDG "exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."[1] MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.[2]

## Why
It was a coincidence that I started learning Elm shortly after watching Scott Pilgrim vs The World and my love for Ramona Flowers was still fresh. I was inspired to make this tool as my first project in Elm. 

It uses the `elm/http`, `elm/svg`, `elm/random`, and `elm-bootstrap` packages. It also makes API calls to generate the name and location of the MPDG.

Soon will write up a report on this project, challenges, and hurdles. Overall, would say as dorky as it is, I had a lot of fun. Elm was challenging, but definitely a lot simpler than some other languages I've used.

## Deploying
The project is deployed using Firebase, and you can view it here:
